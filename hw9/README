Samuel Vaughan and Feiyu Lu

We would like to thank the course staff and TAs for help debugging our code and 
for generally helping us to understand the project. We would also like to thank
our previous partners on the UM for help in understanding UM programming in
general.

We feel that the entire program has been properly implemented.

We departed from the calling conventions in sub-functions within the print
module, because these are self contained within the module, so use of registers
to pass data around and not actively saving callee saved registers is okay. 

Print uses a recursive function for printing positive numbers that stores the
least significant digit and then calls print on the most significant digits,
and it makes negative numbers positive and treats 0 and 0x80000000 as special
cases.


We spent about 4 hours analyizing the assignment
We spent about 3 hours writing assembly code
We spent about 5 hours debugging assembly code
